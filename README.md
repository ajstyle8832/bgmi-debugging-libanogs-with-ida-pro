This README discusses various technical methods for creating anti-ban systems in games. These techniques, while theoretically interesting and often complex, can be against the terms of service of many games. The information provided here is strictly for educational and informational purposes only.

## SEGV Signal Handler

This method involves setting up a signal handler for segmentation faults (SIGSEGV), which are often caused by access violations. The handler helps analyze the call stack and can bypass certain checks.

### Steps

1. Write a signal handler that catches segmentation faults.
2. Install the handler early in your program's execution.
3. Use the handler to log or modify the program's state upon catching the signal.

### Example Code

```c
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <execinfo.h>

void segv_handler(int sig, siginfo_t *si, void *unused) {
    printf("Got SIGSEGV at address: %p\n", si->si_addr);
    
    void *array[10];
    size_t size = backtrace(array, 10);
    
    backtrace_symbols_fd(array, size, STDERR_FILENO);
    _exit(1);
}

int main(void) {
    struct sigaction sa;
    
    sa.sa_flags = SA_SIGINFO;
    sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);
    sa.sa_sigaction = segv_handler;
    
    if (sigaction(SIGSEGV, &sa, NULL) == -1)
        perror("sigaction");
    
    // Cause a segmentation fault.
    *(int*)NULL = 1;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Objection Framework with Frida

Frida is a dynamic instrumentation toolkit used to inject JavaScript or libraries into native apps. This can be used to modify game behavior on-the-fly.

### Steps

1. Root the device or use a rooted emulator.
2. Write a Frida script to hook into function entry points.
3. Run the Frida server on the device.
4. Use the script to intercept and modify function calls.

### Example Frida Script

```javascript
// Assume intercepting "com.example.game.libanogs.SomeFunction"
Interceptor.attach(Module.findExportByName("libanogs.so", "SomeFunction"), {
    onEnter: function (args) {
        console.log("SomeFunction called");
        // Modify arguments or perform actions before the original function execution
    },
    onLeave: function (retval) {
        // Modify the return value or cleanup after execution
    }
});
```

## GDB rbreak

GDB is a debugger for Unix-like systems that supports remote debugging and can be used to set breakpoints dynamically.

### Steps

1. Attach GDB to the process.
2. Use `rbreak` to set breakpoints on functions by regex.
3. Use a script to automate the continuation of execution upon hitting breakpoints.

### Example GDB Commands

```gdb
(gdb) attach [pid]
(gdb) rbreak ^libanogs_  // To break on functions starting with 'libanogs_'
(gdb) continue
```

## IDA Pro and IDAPython Scripting

IDA Pro is extensively used in reverse engineering. Its scripting capabilities allow for automated and detailed analysis.

### Steps

1. Open the target binary or library in IDA Pro.
2. Use IDAPython to set breakpoints on all functions.
3. Configure IDA to run your script at start-up.

### Example IDAPython Script

```python
import idaapi
import idc
import idautils

module_name = "libanogs.so"

def set_trace_breakpoints(module_name):
    for seg in idautils.Segments():
        if module_name in idaapi.get_segm_name(seg):
            for func_ea in idautils.Functions(seg, idaapi.get_segm_end(seg)):
                idc.add_bpt(func_ea)
                idc.set_bpt_attr(func_ea, idc.BPTATTR_FLAGS, idc.BPT_ENABLED)

set_trace_breakpoints(module_name)
```

Attempting to alter or bypass a game's security measures is likely to violate its terms of service and can result in disciplinary action including permanent bans. The methods discussed are for educational purposes only and should not be used in any unauthorized manner.

This document does not encourage or condone any actions that violate the terms of service of any software.
